# Devtools / `/verify` Gaps Log

Running log of gaps in the `/verify` workflow or the devtools harness, and the smallest
improvement that would have closed each one.

**Why this file exists.** The harness can only be improved from evidence, and the evidence
is perishable — the moment a workaround is found, the friction that forced it is forgotten.
This log is the harness's feedback channel: entries here are what later get upstreamed into
`godot-selftest-harness` itself, so a gap logged in one game becomes a fixed feature for
every game.

**Append a new entry at the end of every response** (a `Stop` hook in
`.claude/settings.json` reminds you when a code change lands without one). An honest
"no gaps this turn" line is a real entry — it is what makes the absence of a gap
distinguishable from a forgotten log.

## Format

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — <what the response did>

- Gap: **<what was missing>** — <evidence: the command run, the output it gave, the
  workaround used instead>
  - Improvement: <the smallest change that would have closed it>
```

Guidelines that make an entry useful later:

- **Quote the evidence.** `devtools.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --property scale`
  is actionable; "get-state was awkward" is not.
- **Say what you did instead.** The workaround is the measure of the gap's cost.
- **Prefer the smallest fix.** "Add `--property` (repeatable) to `get-state`" beats
  "improve state inspection".
- **Note recurrences.** A gap that bites a second time is a stronger signal than a new
  one — say so rather than writing a fresh entry as if it were novel.
- **Log closures too.** When a gap gets fixed, record that, and record whether the fix
  actually paid off on the next run.

## 2026-08-01 — Re-ran `/scaffold-godot-harness` to refresh the harness in place

- Gap: **Scaffold overwrote `tools/*` and left `.bak` files it can never clean up** —
  step 4 backs up on any byte difference, so a pure version bump of the harness's own
  files produced `tools/lint_project.gd.bak`, `tools/run_tests.gd.bak`,
  `tools/devtools.py.bak` as untracked repo noise. Diffing each showed only upstream
  template evolution (new flags, new docstrings); no project edits existed to protect.
  Workaround: diffed all three by hand to confirm they were disposable, then reported
  them to the user rather than deleting unprompted.
  - Improvement: have step 4 skip the backup when the existing file matches a *known
    previous template version* — e.g. stamp a `# harness-version: N` header into copied
    tools and only back up when the target's stamp is absent or modified.

- Gap: **Step 7's config patch has no way to know a key was deliberately customized** —
  merging `hud_layer_name` worked only because the existing value (`UI2`) happened to be
  non-default; a project that legitimately set it back to `"HUD"` would be
  indistinguishable from an unpatched default on the next refresh.
  - Improvement: write a `"_scaffold_defaults"` sidecar block into
    `devtools_config.json` recording the values scaffold last wrote, so a later run can
    diff "what I wrote" against "what's there now" and only overwrite untouched keys.

- Gap: **No verb reports which harness version is installed** — deciding whether this
  refresh was a no-op or a real upgrade required diffing template files against the
  repo by hand. `list-commands` shows verbs but not the harness revision.
  - Improvement: add a `harness-version` verb (and a line in `lint_project.gd`'s header
    output) reporting the template revision the installed files came from.
